    "content": "\n      <h2>The Hidden Danger of Traditional Harnesses</h2>\n      <p>Traditional fall protection harnesses have a critical flaw: while they successfully arrest falls, they can create life-threatening conditions during suspension. Concentrated strap pressures and compromised posture can lead to suspension trauma within minutes.</p>\n      \n      <h2>What Makes Kinetic Systems Different</h2>\n      <p>The Kinetic Fall-Arrest System is engineered to redistribute forces across a wider area of the body, maintaining circulation and preserving the worker's ability to breathe, signal, and assist in their own rescue.</p>\n      \n      <h3>Key Benefits:</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Pressure Distribution:</strong> Spreads load across torso and legs</li>\n        <li><strong>Posture Preservation:</strong> Maintains upright position during suspension</li>\n        <li><strong>Extended Survivability:</strong> Up to 3x longer safe suspension time</li>\n        <li><strong>ANSI Certified:</strong> Meets all Z359.1-2016 requirements</li>\n      </ul>\n      \n      <h2>Real-World Impact</h2>\n      <p>Field testing shows that workers suspended in traditional harnesses experience discomfort within 2-3 minutes and dangerous circulation issues within 5-10 minutes. Our kinetic geometry extends this timeline significantly, providing crucial extra time for rescue operations.</p>\n      \n      <blockquote>\n        <p>\"The kinetic design gave our rescue team the time they needed.

      <h2>The Hidden Danger of Traditional Harnesses</h2>
      <p>Traditional fall protection harnesses have a critical flaw: while they successfully arrest falls, they can create life-threatening conditions during suspension. Concentrated strap pressures and compromised posture can lead to suspension trauma within minutes.</p>
      
      <h2>What Makes Kinetic Systems Different</h2>
      <p>The Kinetic Fall-Arrest System is engineered to redistribute forces across a wider area of the body, maintaining circulation and preserving the worker's ability to breathe, signal, and assist in their own rescue.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Benefits:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pressure Distribution:</strong> Spreads load across torso and legs</li>
        <li><strong>Posture Preservation:</strong> Maintains upright position during suspension</li>
        <li><strong>Extended Survivability:</strong> Up to 3x longer safe suspension time</li>
        <li><strong>ANSI Certified:</strong> Meets all Z359.1-2016 requirements</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Real-World Impact</h2>
      <p>Field testing shows that workers suspended in traditional harnesses experience discomfort within 2-3 minutes and dangerous circulation issues within 5-10 minutes. Our kinetic geometry extends this timeline significantly, providing crucial extra time for rescue operations.</p>

        <li><strong>Deceleration Distance:</strong> Additional 3.5 feet maximum</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Training Requirements</h2>
      <p>OSHA mandates that workers using fall protection equipment receive training on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Proper use and inspection of equipment</li>
        <li>Anchor point selection and installation</li>
        <li>Rescue procedures and emergency response</li>
        <li>Equipment limitations and manufacturer instructions</li>

      <h2>Understanding Suspension Trauma</h2>
      <p>Suspension trauma, also known as orthostatic intolerance or harness hang syndrome, is a potentially fatal condition that can occur when a person is suspended motionless in a harness.</p>
      
      <h2>The Physiological Process</h2>
      <p>When suspended in a traditional harness, several dangerous processes begin:</p>
      
      <h3>1. Venous Pooling</h3>
      <p>Blood pools in the legs due to gravity and restricted movement, reducing blood return to the heart.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Pressure Points</h3>
      <p>Narrow straps create concentrated pressure on arteries and nerves, further restricting circulation.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Postural Effects</h3>
      <p>Forward-leaning posture compresses the chest and restricts breathing capacity.</p>
      
      <h2>Timeline of Symptoms</h2>
      <div class="bg-danger-50 border border-danger-200 rounded-xl p-6 my-6">
        <h3 class="font-bold text-danger-800 mb-3">Critical Timeline:</h3>
        <ul class="text-danger-700 space-y-1">
          <li><strong>0-5 minutes:</strong> Initial discomfort, mild numbness</li>
          <li><strong>5-10 minutes:</strong> Significant discomfort, tingling</li>
          <li><strong>10-15 minutes:</strong> Pain, loss of sensation in legs</li>
          <li><strong>15+ minutes:</strong> Potential loss of consciousness, cardiac issues</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <h2>Prevention Strategies</h2>
      
      <h3>Design-Based Prevention</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wide Strap Distribution:</strong> Spreads pressure over larger surface area</li>
        <li><strong>Kinetic Geometry:</strong> Maintains natural body position</li>
        <li><strong>Circulation Preservation:</strong> Reduces pressure on major arteries</li>
        <li><strong>Posture Support:</strong> Keeps worker upright during suspension</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Operational Procedures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rapid Rescue Plans:</strong> Pre-established rescue procedures</li>
        <li><strong>Communication Systems:</strong> Immediate contact with suspended workers</li>
        <li><strong>Relief Techniques:</strong> Movement exercises to maintain circulation</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency Equipment:</strong> Rescue devices for quick extraction</li>
      </ul>
